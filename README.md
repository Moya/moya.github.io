## Moya Documentation

This repository hosts the in source documentation for [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya). 
You can view this at [moya.github.io](https://moya.github.io).

### Maintenance

The documentation is auto-generated using [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy).
**Installing Jazzy**
```
[sudo] gem install jazzy
```
After you have jazzy installed, cd into the Moya directory and run:
```
jazzy -o ../moya.github.io
```
The output path reflects having both the Moya and moya.github.io projects in the same directory.
